$Crowdy$ is an extensible general-purpose crowdsourcing platform to solve 
complex problems. The platform is developed over the fundamentals of stream 
processing paradigm in which a series of operations are applied to the continuous 
stream of data elements via operators.

$Crowdy$ is an operator-centric platform. Using this platform, a requester with no 
requirement of programming background can quickly translate a complex problem into 
a crowdsourcing application by simply selecting operators and connecting these operators 
together. Thanks to $Crowdy$'s focus on operators, requesters can design applications 
by selecting right set of building blocks that are necessary to solve a complex problem 
and customizing these blocks particular to the computation to-be-conducted.

$Crowdy$ embodies several features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A standard toolkit of operators that can employ computation resources 
	(human or software) to accomplish various tasks
	\item Configuration support to design coordination of computation resources 
	over operators
	\item Operator parameterization and customization for support of customizable 
	collaborations
	\item Application runtime interface
\end{itemize}

In the remainder of this chapter, the fundamental concepts of $Crowdy$ are explained 
in more detail and features are explored as we look into various aspects of application 
development over $Crowdy$ platform.
