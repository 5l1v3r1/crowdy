First and foremost I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor, 
who let me explore my research ideas and has supported me throughout my 
thesis with his guidance, knowledge and patience. This work would not have 
been completed without him, to whom I am greatly indebted.

I am thankful to all the faculty at Bilkent University, especially in the Computer 
Engineering department. They were always there to teach, discuss and 
support any matter. I have been blessed with a friendly and sophisticated 
group of faculty members. My research would not have been possible 
without their help.

I would also like to thank the current and former staff at Bilkent University 
for their various forms of support during my study. Among them I express 
my warm thanks to Nimet Kaya for being one of a kind.

I thank to my fellow classmates and colleagues. I am glad to have 
interacted with many on various occasions.

I am grateful to my friends for their support and encouragement throughout. 
I have to give a special mention for the support given by Mehmet Volkan 
Ka\c{s}{\i}k\c{c}{\i} and Abdullah Ba\c{s}ar Akbay.

Finally, I would like to thank God, whose many blessings have made me 
who I am today. A year's worth of effort, frustration and achievement is 
summarized in the following document.
