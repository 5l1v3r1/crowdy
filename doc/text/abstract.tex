\thispagestyle{plain}
\begin{abstract}
Write the abstract here.  Please note that an abstract is not the narrative form of contents page.
Instead, it should give the same content as in the thesis, and must not be just a pointer to the content of the 
thesis.  Avoid unnecessary words like 
``In this thesis,''; it is clear that this is the abstract of this thesis, anyway.
A good abstract should containe balanced material from each and every chapter of the thesis, and tell essentially the
same  thing.  A common mistake is to write too much from introduction and conclusion chapters, but too little from
anything in between.
